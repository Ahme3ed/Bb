	•	Creative / advanced features (AI, automation, UX innovations — differentiators)
	•	UX flow notes (practical flows you must implement)
	•	Integrations / events / background jobs

Recommended Priorities for a Real Project (MVP → v1 → v2)

MVP (get to usable product quickly):
	1.	Core multi-tenant auth & RBAC
	2.	Products & basic Inventory (single warehouse), basic Sales (quotes/orders)
	3.	Bulk import (products) + stock-take flow
	4.	Simple Accounting: invoice generation & payments integration
	5.	Admin UI & settings

v1 (next 3 months):
	•	Multi-warehouse inventory, reservations, replenishment rules
	•	Complete Purchasing & 3-way matching
	•	Improved Accounting (journal entries, reconciliation)
	•	Reporting & scheduled exports

v2 (scale / differentiation):
	•	Manufacturing, MRP, Quality control
	•	POS & E-commerce headless storefront
	•	Projects & timesheets
	•	BI & AI features (forecasting, anomaly detection, assistant)

⸻

Cross-cutting technical recommendations
	•	Tech stack: Next.js App Router (React) + Node API (or Next API routes) + Prisma + PostgreSQL (JSONB where helpful) + Redis + BullMQ for queues + object storage (S3) + ClickHouse/BigQuery later for analytics.
	•	Architecture: Shared DB multi-tenancy (tenantId on each row) for MVP. Design to allow schema-per-tenant or DB-per-tenant in future.
	•	Realtime: Use WebSockets or server-sent events for live inventory and job updates.
	•	Background processing: All heavy operations (imports, exports, image processing, scheduled reports, AI inference) go to a job queue.
	•	Observability: Central logging, tracing (OpenTelemetry), alerting for failed jobs, and metrics (Prometheus/Grafana).
	•	Security: Column-level encryption for PII, rate limiting, SSO support, CSP, regular pen-testing.
	•	Testing: Unit+integration tests for business logic, contract tests for external integrations; seed realistic test data per tenant.

⸻

Next actionable steps I can do for you immediately (pick one or more)
	1.	Generate complete Prisma schema for selected modules (Core + Products + Inventory + Import jobs + Sales) — ready to prisma migrate.
	2.	Produce an API contract (OpenAPI) for the MVP modules (auth, products, import, stock-take, sales) so front-end can start.
	3.	Scaffold Next.js folder structure & sample pages/components for Products import + Stock-take UI (TSX + Tailwind).
	4.	Provide DB migration scripts and seed data for demo tenant.
	5.	Sketch wireframes (text-based or simple PNGs) for bulk import wizard and stock-take mobile UI.

Tell me which one you want first (or ask for the Prisma schema here) and I’ll generate it right away — everything done in this chat.
